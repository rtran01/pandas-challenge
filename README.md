Pandas Homework
Introduction:
	A recent free-to-play fantasy game “Heroes of Pymoli” was recently released by an independent gaming company. The game itself is free-to-play but has optional in-game purchases that can enhance their playing experience. The independent gaming company wanted to analyze the game’s purchasing data and analyze any trends that can be extrapolated. A purchasing datafile (HeroesOfPymoli_data.csv) was extracted from the game and was analyzed through Jupyter Notebooks using the PANDAS module.  

The datafile is located in the resources folder and the Jupyter Notebook can be found in the main folder "HeroesOfPymoli" as "HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb", which contains the codes used to analyze the data file "HeroesOfPymoli_data.csv".
